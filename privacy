Basic device and app diagnostic information (such as device model, iOS version, and crash/diagnostic data) may be collected if enabled via your device settings or used within the App to improve stability and performance.

Improve reliability and fix bugs (performance monitoring, diagnostics).

Support subscriptions and restore purchases.

Respond to support requests.

5) Metrics and Estimates

Some outputs in the App (for example: time saved, money saved, usage-related estimates, or “clarity” scoring) may be based on your inputs and generalized assumptions. These are provided for informational purposes and may not be perfectly accurate.

6) How We Share Information

We do not sell your personal information.

We may share limited information only in these cases:

Service providers: Vendors who help operate essential services (e.g., hosting, diagnostics) may process data on our behalf under obligations to protect it and use it only to provide their services.
